## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student at ISyE, Georgia Tech. I obtained M.S. in Quantitative and Computational Finance from the same institute. Before that, I obtained B.S. in Mathematics from Fudan University.

I work with [George Lan](https://sites.gatech.edu/guanghui-lan/) on the ... I work with [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/) on ... I have also been fortunate enough to collaborate with [Anatoli Juditsky](https://sites.google.com/view/anatoli-juditsky) on ...

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the design and analysis of novel first-order methods for *Nonlinear Optimization*, *Stochastic Optimization*, and *Reinforcement Learning*. I also actively pursue the practical value of these methods in relevant applications. I am particularly interested in

- **Policy optimization and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning :** 
- **Parameter-free first-order methods for convex and nonconvex optimization:** 
- **Stochastic optimization methods for statistical learning and machine learning:**
- **Real-life applications:** healthcare, 4inancial industry, and E-commerce
